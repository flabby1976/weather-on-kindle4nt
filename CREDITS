Inspired by Matthew Petroff's Kindle Weather Display project https://github.com/mpetroff/kindle-weather-display. The weather icons, the SVG file file method of building the weather display image and the conversion to PNG for the kindle are all taken from this project.

Draws heavily from https://github.com/ufuchs/weather-on-kindle4nt, which itself implements the kindle-side functions from https://github.com/mpetroff/kindle-weather-display but puts the kindle to sleep between display updates, rather than using cron, which means it can run on battery for weeks/months without charging! Also this implementation uses kite to start/stop the program, so the kindle can still be used as an e-reader as required. Most of the shell scripts are taken directly from this project, with relatively minor changes. 

Also draws from https://github.com/scolby33/weather_kindle, which implements the server-side functions from https://github.com/mpetroff/kindle-weather-display on the kindle itself, thus making a completely standalone kindle weather display. The executables pngcrush and rsvg-convert as well as the associated lib files in weather/lib, which allow the generation of the weather display image on the kindle, are taken directly from this project
