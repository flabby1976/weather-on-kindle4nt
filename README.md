## TO BE UPDATED!!

weather-on-kindle4nt
=====================

## Features

- The original function as an ebook reader remains
- Doesn't require any crontab usage
- Caches the last successfully downloaded weather file until it expires at 24:00
  (So you can take away your 'weather station' in the pub and show it all your friends.)
- The download is written in the '/tmp' directory which is a temporary filesystem(32M), living in the memory

Please take a look at the [release](https://github.com/ufuchs/weather-on-kindle4nt/releases) page.  

__Note__  
You need to install [kite](https://github.com/ufuchs/kite-kindle4nt) to launch the program.  
_Before_ that you have to jailbreak the Kindle and to install the [USBNetwork Hacks](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004).  
Please use the 
- kindle-usbnetwork-0.53.N-k4.rar (2.85 MB) 

from the 'Attached Files' section on this site.  
[Jeniffer](http://www.shatteredhaven.com/2012/11/1337365-ssh-on-kindle-4-usbnetwork-hack.html) has written a very good tutorial, esp. for the Windows guys.
